 Requirements Document

1. Problem Statement
Learning and building with new technologies is slow and frustrating for students and early-stage developers. Existing learning platforms are static and theory-heavy, while developer tools focus on productivity for experienced engineers rather than learning support. Learners often struggle to understand *why* code works, leading to shallow understanding and heavy context switching between documentation, tutorials, and code editors.
 2. Proposed Solution
An AI-powered learning and developer productivity assistant that enables learning through building. The system understands a learner’s code, questions, and current skill level to deliver contextual explanations, guided learning paths, and actionable insights in real time.
The solution acts as a personal AI mentor, embedded into the learning workflow rather than replacing it.

3. Why AI is Required
This problem cannot be effectively solved using rule-based systems because:
- Learner questions are open-ended and contextual
- Code understanding requires semantic reasoning, not pattern matching
- Learning styles and knowledge levels vary across users

AI enables:
- Natural language and code understanding
- Adaptive explanation generation
- Personalized learning recommendations
- Context-aware feedback based on real user input

4. Target Users
- College students learning programming and software development
- Early-career developers onboarding new technologies
- Self-learners building real-world projects

 5. Key Objectives
- Reduce learning time while building applications
- Minimize context switching during development
- Improve conceptual understanding instead of rote memorization
- Enable self-paced, personalized learning

 6. Functional Requirements
- Context-aware AI explanations for code and concepts
- Personalized learning path generation
- Intelligent documentation summarization
- Skill-level adaptive responses
- Learning progress tracking

 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalable and responsive system
- Secure handling of user data
- Clear distinction between AI-generated and factual content
- Ethical and responsible AI usage

 8. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
Unlike existing AI coding tools focused on productivity, this solution is designed specifically for **learning while building**, making it highly effective for students and early developers—an underserved segment in current AI developer ecosystems.
